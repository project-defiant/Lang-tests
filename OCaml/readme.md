# OCaml language


## main concepts

OCaml is a function programming language. It uses following syntax.

```{OCaml}
let x = 50;;
```

Variables are immutable (they are constant). To use mutable variables one need to use `references`.

### Lists

lists are created with following syntax:

```{OCaml}
let empty_list = [];;
let int_list = [1;2;3];;
```

Important note is that list elements are split by semicolon, not comma.
